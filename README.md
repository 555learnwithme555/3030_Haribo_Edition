## Introduction
Inspiration for the project came from [davtr](http://www.thingiverse.com/davtr/about) mk2 conversion [Prusa i3 MK2-X](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1692666)

The use of 3030 extrusion makes the frame very rigid and square.  It takes a lot of the guess work out of building the MK2

The name is from the candy that we get when we buy the MK2 kits.  Somebody jokingly said that's a good name and it sort of stuck.
