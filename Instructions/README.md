## Important measurements

The only one that you need to worry about is the spacing of the y rod holders.

On the reference build, each y rod holder is 67.75mm from the edge of the extrusion.

Ensure the front and back measurements are the same to make the rods parallel.  Then adjust position of the bearing holders so that the y carriage slides smooth.

## Guidelines

- build on a level hard surface and ensure the frame is square as you tighten the frame bolts.
- when installing the frame braces, tighten them but don't go hulk strength and crack them.
- I found fender washer for the y carriage bolts spread the load and help maintain consisntent contact
