# User Submission

- All PR request for additional STL submissions to the project should be put here and in the PR please put in a short description
- Expectation is that the STL has been printed and tested with actual usage and a purpose
- Upon review of the STL, it will be promoted to the correct location in the STL folder (root, optional, etc)

I will try to do the review and promote in a timely manner, but please don't rush me
