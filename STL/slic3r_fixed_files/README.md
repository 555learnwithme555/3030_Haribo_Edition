# slic3r_fixed_files

## What are those?!?

Slic3r and some other tools are complaining about non-manifold meshes in some of the files.

Simplify3D, Cura and Netfabb Standard seems to be ok with these files

## Why are they here??

Instead of merging them into the main STL directory, they will be here instead.

if you have problems with your slicer of choice, use these files.

it might not be updated as frequently as the main STL since it's a post process step, but we will make every effort to do it as soon as possible
